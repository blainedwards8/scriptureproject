# Abinadi
Preached to the [[Nephites]] in the [[Land of Nephi]].  He was captured by [[Noah (Nephite)|Noah's]] guards after he preached that the Noah would be killed for his wickedness. Abinadi preached in front of Noah and his priests, which included [[Alma I]].  After hearing Abinadi's teachines, Alma sought to save Abinadi's life.  Alma was chased away by the guards.  Noah had Abinadi burned alive.  During his execution, Abinadi prophecied that Noah would die in a similar manner and the descendants of the priests would cause others to suffer the same way.
