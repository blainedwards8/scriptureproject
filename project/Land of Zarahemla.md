# Land of Zarahemla
The land where the [[Mulekites]] inhabited.  The chief city of the land was named [[City of Zarahemla|Zarahemla]], which was in turn named after the last king of the Mulekites, bearing the same [[Zarahemla|name]].

This is the land where [[Mosiah I]] discovered the [[Mulekites]] after fleeing the [[Land of Nephi]] to escape the [[Lamanites]].  The [[Nephites]] joined with the [[Mulekites]] and was known simply as Nephites after this point.
