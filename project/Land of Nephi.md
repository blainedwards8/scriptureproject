# Land of Nephi

After Mosiah left the Land of Nephi, a group of [[Nephites]] desired to return to the Land of Nephi to inhabit it.  By this time, the [[Lamanites]] had inhabited all the land. 

[[Zeniff]] made a deal with the king of the [[Lamanites]] to inherit the [[City of Lehi- Nephi]] and the [[City of Shilom]].
